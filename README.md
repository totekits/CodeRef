# FuncCodeRef
Welcome to Functionality-based Code Reference Repository! This repo contains a collection of reference files I've created while learning various coding languages. They are designed to serve as handy manuals for programmers to quickly access the information they need to perform certain tasks.

I've organized each file using a functionality-based approach. This means that each file is structured to help you find the information you need quickly based on the specific functionality you're looking for.

For now, it contains only Ruby. My plan is to include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the near future.
