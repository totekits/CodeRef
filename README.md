# CodeRef
Welcome to CodeRef! This repo contains a collection of reference files I've created while learning various coding languages. They are designed to serve as handy manuals for programmers to quickly access the information they need to perform certain tasks.

For now, it contains only Ruby. My plan is to include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the near future. 

## Contributions and Feedback
If you find these reference files useful and would like to contribute, please feel free to do so. Contributions from the community are greatly appreciated, whether it's correcting errors, adding new information, or suggesting improvements. Please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Get Started
I hope you find these reference files useful.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I wish you all the best in your learning journey!

Happy coding!
